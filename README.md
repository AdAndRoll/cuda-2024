# Tasks
## Task #1: OpenMP GELU Implementation
The **Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU)** is an activation function frequently used in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and can be thought of as a smoother ReLU.

To approximate GELU function, use the following formula:

GELU(x) =  $0.5x(1 + tanh(\sqrt{2 / \pi}(x + 0.044715 * x^3)))$

Implement the function with the following interface in C++:
```cpp
std::vector<float> GeluOMP(const std::vector<float>& input);
```
Size of result vector should be the same as for `input`. Use OpenMP technology to make your function parallel & fast.

Two files are expected to be uploaded:
- gelu_omp.h
```cpp
#ifndef __GELU_OMP_H
#define __GELU_OMP_H

#include <vector>

std::vector<float> GeluOMP(const std::vector<float>& input);

#endif // __GELU_OMP_H
```
- gelu_omp.cpp

#include "gelu_omp.h"

std::vector<float> GeluOMP(const std::vector<float>& input) {
    // Place your implementation here
}
```
## Task #2: CUDA GELU Implementation
Implement the function with the following interface in CUDA C++ using the formula described above:
```cpp
std::vector<float> GeluCUDA(const std::vector<float>& input);
```
Size of result vector should be the same as for `input`. Use CUDA technology to make your function working on NVIDIA GPU. Try to make it fast.

## Task #3: Naive Matrix Multiplication using OpenMP
General matrix multiplication (GEMM) is a very basic and broadly used linear algebra operation applied in high performance computing (HPC), statistics, deep learning and other domains. There are a lot of GEMM algorithms with different mathematical complexity form $O(n^3)$ for naive and block approaches to $O(n^{2.371552})$ for the method descibed by Williams et al. in 2024 [[1](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611977912.134)]. But despite a variety of algorithms with low complexity, block matrix multiplication remains the most used implementation in practice since it fits to modern HW better.

To start learning matrix multiplication smoother, let us start with naive approach here. To compute matrix multiplication result C for matricies A and B, where C = A * B and the size for all matricies are $n*n$, one should use the following formula for each element of C (will consider only square matricies for simplicity):

$c_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^na_{ik}b_{kj}$

To complete the task one should implement a function that multiplies two square matricies using OpenMP with the following interface:
```cpp
std::vector<float> NaiveGemmOMP(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                const std::vector<float>& b,
                                int n);
```
Each matrix must be stored in a linear array by rows, so that `a.size()==n*n`. Function takes two matricies and their size as inputs, and returns result matrix also stored by rows.
For simplicity, let's consider matrix size is always power of 2.

Two files are expected to be uploaded:
- naive_gemm_omp.h:
```cpp
#ifndef __NAIVE_GEMM_OMP_H
#define __NAIVE_GEMM_OMP_H

#include <vector>

std::vector<float> NaiveGemmOMP(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                const std::vector<float>& b,
                                int n);

#endif // __NAIVE_GEMM_OMP_H
```
- naive_gemm_omp.cpp:
```cpp
#include "naive_gemm_omp.h"

std::vector<float> NaiveGemmOMP(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                const std::vector<float>& b,
                                int n) {
    // Place your implementation here
}
```

## Task #4: Naive Matrix Multiplication using CUDA
In this task one should implement naive approach for matrix multiplication in CUDA trying to make it fast enough *(pay attention to global memory accesses in your code)*.

Each matrix must be stored in a linear array by rows, so that `a.size()==n*n`. Function takes two matricies and their size as inputs, and returns result matrix also stored by rows.
For simplicity, let's consider matrix size is always power of 2.

Two files are expected to be uploaded:
- naive_gemm_cuda.h:
```cpp
#ifndef __NAIVE_GEMM_CUDA_H
#define __NAIVE_GEMM_CUDA_H

#include <vector>

std::vector<float> NaiveGemmCUDA(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                 const std::vector<float>& b,
                                 int n);

#endif // __NAIVE_GEMM_CUDA_H
```
- naive_gemm_cuda.cu:
```cpp
#include "naive_gemm_cuda.h"

std::vector<float> NaiveGemmCUDA(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                 const std::vector<float>& b,
                                 int n) {
    // Place your implementation here
}
```

## Task #5: Block Matrix Multiplication using OpenMP
In real applications block-based approach for matrix multiplication can get multiple times faster execution comparing with naive version due to cache friendly approach. To prove this in practice, implement such a version in C++ using OpenMP.

In block version algorithm could be divided into three stages:
1. Split matricies into blocks (block size normally affects performance significantly so choose it consciously);
2. Multiply two blocks to get partial result;
3. Replay step 2 for all row/column blocks accumulating values into a single result block.

From math perspective, block matrix multiplication could be described by the following formula, where $C_{IJ}$, $A_{IK}$ and $B_{KJ}$ are sub-matricies with the size $block\_size*block\_size$:

$C_{IJ}=\sum_{k=1}^{block_count}A_{IK}B_{KJ}$

Each matrix must be stored in a linear array by rows, so that `a.size()==n*n`. Function takes two matricies and their size as inputs, and returns result matrix also stored by rows.
For simplicity, let's consider matrix size is always power of 2.

Two files are expected to be uploaded:
- block_gemm_omp.h:
```cpp
#ifndef __BLOCK_GEMM_OMP_H
#define __BLOCK_GEMM_OMP_H

#include <vector>

std::vector<float> BlockGemmOMP(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                const std::vector<float>& b,
                                int n);

#endif // __BLOCK_GEMM_OMP_H
```
- block_gemm_omp.cpp:
```cpp
#include "block_gemm_omp.h"

std::vector<float> BlockGemmOMP(const std::vector<float>& a,
                                const std::vector<float>& b,
                                int n) {
    // Place your implementation here
}
```

As in previous task, let us consider all matricies are square.

## Task #6: Block Matrix Multiplication using CUDA
In CUDA C++ block-based approach looks similar. But to get better performance one should use CUDA shared memory to store each particular block while computations. With this consideration, algorithm will be the following:
1. A single CUDA block should compute a single block of result matrix C, a single CUDA thread - a single matrix C element;
2. For each A block in a row and B block in a column:
    1. Load A block into shared memory;
    2. Load B block into shared memory;
    3. Synchronize over all threads in block;
    4. Compute BlockA * BlockB and accumulate into C block in shared memory;
    5. Synchronize over all threads in block;
3. Dump block C from shared to global memory.

Each matrix must be stored in a linear array by rows, so that `a.size()==n*n`. Function takes two matricies and their size as inputs, and returns result matrix also stored by rows.
For simplicity, let's consider matrix size is always power of 2.

                                 int n);

                                 int n) {
    // Place your implementation here
}
